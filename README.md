All Things GRAFT 
Heavy Bitcoin enthusiast. Studied economics and political science back in the UC days of the 70/80s. Coming full circle as I dive, dive, and dive into The Blockchain space. Looking to see and support the complete paradigm shift in payment processing, transfer of value, and stored value.  Where can I assist, where can I market, and where can I sell and advocate...?
